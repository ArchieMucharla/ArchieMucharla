# Hi, I’m Archie! 👋  
I'm a developer, designer, and data scientist who loves building things that are both smart and usable.

🎓 I'm currently pursuing an M.S. in Computer Science at UIUC!

---

## 🛠️ What I Do

I love working on:
- 🧠 Intelligent systems that help people make better decisions (recommendation engines, knowledge graphs, scheduling tools).
- 🎨 Thoughtful, accessible design — I started as a designer and still obsess over UX.
- 🧪 Data-driven projects that answer real questions (or automate the boring stuff).

---

## 🚀 Projects Worth Checking Out

- [**Timely**](https://github.com/ArchieMucharla/Timely) – an intelligent scheduling assistant I built the backend for (Flask + MongoDB)
