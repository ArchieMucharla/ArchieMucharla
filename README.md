# Welcome! I’m Archie! 
I'm a developer, designer, and data scientist who loves building things that are both smart and usable.

🎓 I'm currently pursuing an M.S. in Computer Science at UIUC!

## What I love!

I enjoy working on:
- Intelligent systems that help people make better decisions (leveraging historical data in the best possible way). 
- Thoughtful, accessible design — I always approach projects with a UX/aesthetics-focused mind. People need to ENJOY the experience of using the product!
- Finding creative ways to automate/optimize the boring, redundant tasks.
- Storytelling with data: EDA, visualizations, just trying everything and being a detective to find patterns in data.
